### Special Note: Personal Branch

All modifications made by the current user to the program **will not** be merged into the mainline; they are written solely for personal convenience.

Therefore, the following steps are unnecessary:

- Internationalization beyond Chinese and English
- Unit testing
- Other heavyweight testing or reliability verification

At the same time, if a modification involves multiple types of channels, generally only the following types of channels need to be handled:

- OpenAI (including traditional Completion and modern Response types)
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini

Users generally do not use other types of channels.
